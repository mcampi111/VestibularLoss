# Abstract 

# Importance: 
Vestibular impairment in children with profound hearing loss (HL) has a major impact on psychomotor development.
# Objectives. 
To determine the prevalence of vestibular impairment in a cohort of cochlear implant (CI) candidate children with profound HL and its impact on postural and motor development.
# Design. 
Retrospective study.
# Setting: 
Pediatric referral center for CI.
# Participants:
All children with profound HL (loss >90dB HL) who completed vestibular assessment prior to CI between 2009 and 2019.
# Main Outcomes and Measures. 
Data were collected from medical records (HL etiologies, complete vestibular assessment, and ages for developmental milestone achievement). Three groups of children were defined: normal vestibular function (NVF), partially-impaired vestibular function (PVF), and complete bilateral vestibular loss (CBVL). Generalized logit models were performed to evaluate predictive factors of vestibular impairment.
# Results. 
A total of 592 children were included (284 females, 308 males, mean (SD) age 38 (34) months, 2 months-18 years). In children with documented etiology, genetic origin represented 44.9% of the cases (120/266); 50% syndromic (mainly Usher and Waardenburg), and 50% non-syndromic (mainly connexin-26). Among infectious origin (74/266), 70.3% were cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
Vestibular impairment was found in 44.4% of the children; it was mostly symmetrical (89%) and complete in 5.7% of the cases. Vestibular impairment was present in 78.3% of children with genetic syndromic HL (56.7% PVF, 21.7% CBVL) and in 69.2% of children with CMV infection (57.7% PVF, 11.5% CBVL). Only genetic syndromic etiology was found to be a good predictor of both PVF and CBVL.
The odds of having delays in four developmental milestones were higher in both PVF and CBVL compared to NVF, and higher in CBVL compared to PVF. All four developmental milestones were predictive of vestibular impairment.
# Conclusions and Relevance
In these CI candidate children with profound HL, vestibular impairment was frequent, varied according to etiology, and impacted postural and motor development. While all developmental milestones were predictive of vestibular impairment, different etiologies differentially predicted vestibular impairment severity. Children with profound HL should benefit from complete vestibular assessment before CI in order to propose an early and adapted management (physical therapy for CBVL and CI strategy).
